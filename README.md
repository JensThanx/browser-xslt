*   JS XSLT Transformator (JXT)   *
***********************************

The JXT is a simple browser application
which offers a frontend to transform 
one XML with one XSL file.
This application runs solely in your
browser, no backend or installation 
needed. Just open 'index.html' in your
browser.

It guides you through the whole 
process:

1. Load an XML file.
JXT will try to parse the file. If
successful, JXT will show some file 
information, otherwise an error message.

2. Load an XSL file.
JXT will try to parse the file. If
successful, JXT will show some file 
information, otherwise an error message.

3. Transform the XML file with the XSL 
using the JavaScript power of your 
browser, only.

4. Download the transformed file. JXT 
will also provide a download link.

FAQ

Q: Is JXT still in development?
A: No, it is finished, no further
improvement planned.

Q: Can JXT transform more than one file?
A: No, not in one cycle. You have to
transform one file at a time.

Q: Is the JXT free?
A: Yes, the JXT may be used by everyone.
Note, that some of the code is not
mine but was gratefully copied from other
sources (see comments in JS files).

Q: Is JXT professional work?
A: No it is not :)
It is one of my first steps with
JavaScript. I just needed some little
tool for XSLT and wanted to learn more
about browser power.
So do not expect it to be perfect.
